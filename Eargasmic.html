                          <p><strong>The Fugees</strong> (formerly Tranzlator Crew) were an American hip hop group who rose to fame in the mid-1990s. Their repertoire included elements of hip hop,
                          soul and Caribbean music, particularly reggae. The members of the group were rapper/singer/producer Wyclef Jean, rapper/singer/producer Lauryn Hill, and rapper/producer Pras Michel. 
                          Deriving their name from the term refugee, Jean is Haitian, while Hill and Michel are American.
                          The group recorded two albums—one of which, The Score (1996), was a multi-Platinum and Grammy-winning success and contains their hit single "Killing Me Softly"—before disbanding in 1997. 
                          In 2007, MTV ranked them the 9th greatest Hip-hop group of all time.</p>

                          The band enjoyed moderate success with a couple of single releases, but a projected album foundered because of record company politics.

                          In 2002 his debut album O reached No. 8 on the UK albums chart, won the Shortlist Music Prize and generated three top-30 singles in the UK.
                          Rice released his second album 9 in 2006 and his songs have appeared in numerous films and television episodes.</p>

                          During the 1970s, he recorded the concept albums What's Going On and Let's Get It On and 
                          became one of the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of its production company.
                          On April 1, 1984, Gaye's father, Marvin Gay Sr., fatally shot him at their house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles.</p>

                          <p><strong>Coldplay</strong> are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL). 
                          After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as a drummer, backing vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist, completing the line-up. 
                          Manager Phil Harvey is often considered an unofficial fifth member. The band renamed themselves "Coldplay" in 1998, before recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998, Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999 and The Blue Room in the same year. 
                          The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.</p>

                           Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released a live album in 2005 called Try!, and his third studio album Continuum in 2006. Both albums received wide critical acclaim, and Continuum earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.

                          <p><strong>U2</strong> are an Irish rock band from Dublin. Formed in 1976 at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency, 
                          the group consists of Bono (vocals and guitar), the Edge (guitar, keyboards, and vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums and percussion). 
                          U2's early sound was rooted in post-punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. Throughout the group's musical pursuits, they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals. 
                          Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.</p>

                          <p><strong>Nirvana</strong> was an American rock band that was formed by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.
                          Nirvana's brief run ended following the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, but various posthumous releases have been issued since, overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love.
                          Since its debut, the band has sold over 25 million records in the United States alone, and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time</p>
